## Offline Functionality

This app is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that works offline:

### What Works Offline
- ‚úÖ Your saved lineup and favourite acts
- ‚úÖ Festival data (stages, acts, times) - cached for 24 hours
- ‚úÖ App interface and navigation
- ‚úÖ Basic functionality for browsing acts and stages

### Offline Features
- **Smart Caching**: Festival data is cached when you first visit and updated when online
- **Offline Indicator**: Shows when you're offline with a helpful message
- **Fallback Page**: Custom offline page when completely disconnected
- **Persistent Storage**: Your saved acts are stored locally and available offline

### How to Use Offline
1. Visit the app once while online to cache the festival data
2. Your saved lineup will be available offline
3. Browse acts and stages even without internet connection
4. Changes to your lineup will sync when you're back online

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the App
```bash
# Development
npm start

# Production build
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

### PWA Features
The app includes:
- Service Worker for offline caching
- Web App Manifest for installation
- Offline fallback pages
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Testing Offline Functionality

1. Build the app: `npm run build`
2. Serve the build folder: `npx serve -s build`
3. Open in browser and visit the app
4. Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Service Workers to see the service worker
5. Go offline in DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Offline
6. Refresh the page - the app should still work!

## Debugging Commands

The app includes several debugging utilities that can be run from the browser console to help troubleshoot offline functionality and service worker issues.

### Service Worker Management
```javascript
// Force update the service worker (useful when testing changes)
window.forceServiceWorkerUpdate()

// Check for service worker updates
window.checkForServiceWorkerUpdates()

// Inspect all caches and their contents
window.inspectCaches()

// Clear all caches (useful for testing from scratch)
window.clearAllCaches()
```

### Common Debugging Scenarios

#### **Service Worker Not Updating**
If you've made changes to the service worker but they're not taking effect:
```javascript
// 1. Force update the service worker
window.forceServiceWorkerUpdate()

// 2. Or manually unregister in DevTools:
// Application ‚Üí Service Workers ‚Üí Unregister
```

#### **Offline Page Appearing When It Shouldn't**
If the app is showing the offline page when you have cached data:
```javascript
// 1. Check what's in your caches
window.inspectCaches()

// 2. Clear all caches and start fresh
window.clearAllCaches()

// 3. Reload the page to rebuild cache
location.reload()
```

#### **Testing Offline Functionality**
To test the offline experience:
1. Visit the app while online to cache data
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Offline
3. Refresh the page
4. The app should work normally with cached content

#### **Checking Cache Contents**
To see exactly what's stored in your caches:
```javascript
// This will log all cache names and their contents
window.inspectCaches()
```

### Manual Service Worker Management
If the debugging commands don't work, you can manually manage the service worker:

1. **Open DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Application tab**
3. **Click "Service Workers" in the left sidebar**
4. **Click "Unregister" to remove the old service worker**
5. **Refresh the page** to register the new one

### Cache Storage Management
To manually inspect or clear caches:
1. **Open DevTools** (F12)
2. **Go to Application tab**
3. **Click "Storage" in the left sidebar**
4. **Expand "Cache Storage"**
5. **Right-click on cache names to delete them**

## üîÑ Data Strategy

The app uses a **network-first** approach for lineup data to ensure you always get the latest information:

1. **Online**: Always fetches the latest data from `https://glasto-lineup.vercel.app/api/lineup-data`
2. **Network fails**: Falls back to cached API data from previous visits
3. **No cached API data**: Falls back to local `/g2025.json` file
4. **Completely offline**: Serves cached app with last known data

This ensures you get real-time lineup updates, schedule changes, and artist additions right up until the festival starts, while still working perfectly offline.
